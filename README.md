## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned how to work with a little more content, up until now there were simple card. I practice and improve the mobile, tablet and desktop design. I used the table element for the last section (I don't know if it is the better option but it worked for me). Copy the design was a challenge, it has dif padding and margins, etc.


### Continued development

I'd like to focus in responsive designs, increasingly upping the difficulty of the challenges.
